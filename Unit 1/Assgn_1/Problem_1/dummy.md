# How the Data is Generated

## 1. Call Arrivals
To simulate a **homogeneous Poisson process** with rate \( \lambda \), we use the fact that the **inter-arrival times** between consecutive calls follow an **Exponential distribution** with mean \( \frac{1}{\lambda} \).

- For this simulation, the rate is chosen as:  
  \[
  \lambda = 2.5 \text{ calls per minute}
  \]

- Thus, the expected time between two consecutive calls is:  
  \[
  \mathbb{E}[\text{inter-arrival time}] = \frac{1}{\lambda} = 0.4 \text{ minutes}
  \]

## 2. Revenues
For each call, a random revenue is generated from an **Exponential distribution** with mean:  
\[
\mu = \$15
\]

This is consistent with the setup in *Problem 1(b)*.

## 3. Output
The script saves the simulated data into a CSV file named:




This file contains **two columns**:

- `timestamp` → the time (in minutes) at which each call arrives  
- `revenue` → the revenue generated by that call

You can then use this file in your analysis code by replacing:

- `'your_data.csv'` → `'call_center_data.csv'`  
- `'timestamp_column'` → `'timestamp'`

---

**Summary:**

- **Process type:** Homogeneous Poisson process  
- **Rate:** \( \lambda = 2.5 \) calls/min  
- **Revenue distribution:** Exponential(\( \mu = \$15 \))  
- **Output file:** `call_center_data.csv` with columns `timestamp`, `revenue`
