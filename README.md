## üéØ Course Objective

[cite_start]This course is designed to develop the mathematical theory of random variables and random processes for Telecom Engineers[cite: 14]. [cite_start]The main goal is to learn the theoretical concepts and techniques required to solve problems that arise in practice[cite: 15]. [cite_start]The curriculum begins with random variables and builds up to the concepts of stochastic processes and the linear filtering of random processes[cite: 16].

## üèÜ Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, I will be able to:

1.  [cite_start]**CO1:** Identify the type of random process associated with a physical phenomenon and model it[cite: 18].
2.  [cite_start]**CO2:** Apply random process concepts to solve engineering and other related problems[cite: 18].
3.  [cite_start]**CO3:** Model physical situations for multidisciplinary fields into suitable random processes and analyze them for project management and finance[cite: 18].
4.  [cite_start]**CO4:** Use computing skills with MATLAB/SPSS to design and analyze different stochastic processes[cite: 18].
5.  [cite_start]**CO5:** Critique the assumptions underlying stochastic models and understand their implications on the validity of the results[cite: 18].
